- Issues with the design:

  - Not consistent with the numeration
  - Doesn't support people with disabilities
  - Unclear buttons (not knowing which button to press)

## Getting B:
- Common sequence of actions: *ideally*

  1. Enter the elevator
  2. Click on the button to go to the specific floor
  3. Elevator gives a visual feedback that the button was pressed
  4. Elevator gives a feedback once it has arrived
  5. Leave the elevator

- How does the elevator support the user figure out how to make it work?
  - Pretty straight forward, except some design issues

- How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?
  - Once a person clicks on the button, it lights up to show that the button was pressed
  - Makes a sound once it has arrived to the specified floor 

- What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?
  - Going to the wrong floor
