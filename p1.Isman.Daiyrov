- Issues with the design:

  - Not consistent with the numeration (missing 2 and 4)
  - Unclear buttons (not knowing which button to press)
  
- Good features of the design:
  - Supports people with disabilities
    - Braille writing system for people who are visually impaired
  - Provides a visual and sound feedback 

## Getting B:
- Common sequence of actions: *ideally*

  1. Enter the elevator
  2. Click on the button to go to the specific floor
  3. Elevator gives a visual feedback that the button was pressed
  4. Elevator gives some feedback once it has arrived
  5. Leave the elevator

- How does the elevator support the user figure out how to make it work?
  - Pretty straight forward, except some design issues

- How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?
  - Once a person clicks on the button, it lights up to show that the button was pressed
  - Makes a sound once it has arrived to the specified floor 

- What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?
  - Going to the wrong floor

- Sketch of a newer and better design:
